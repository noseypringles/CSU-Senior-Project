## Statement of Purpose (with Problem Statement)
The purpose for this project is to have a working e-commerce (online shopping) website that can handle sales transactions, inventory tracking, and saves information/receipts in a database for a certain amount of time before it deletes it. The customer should be able to view products and make a purchase and with the purchase, see that the transaction is a success and money is taken from the source of pay provided. Along with a purchase, the admin of the website should see that a transaction was made and see the purchases.

The problem is that the client only has Facebook as a way of communication and prompting through Facebook and word-by-mouth. In order for the client to expand their business, they need a website to read a bigger audience. The reason for a bigger audience is so that they can sell premade clothes, display the products, and another way for the clients’ customers to get in contact with them to ask questions or for alterations.
  
The solution to the problem is to make an e-commerce website for the client’s business for the customers to browse through the premade products in stock and see past products that were made. This also facilitates transactions between the client and their customers since multiple transactions from different customers can happen at the same time compared to only making one transaction at a time when meeting face-to-face. The website provides a faster way of shopping for the customers since everything will be a click away wherever they are located and gives more time to the client in order to focus on making the products.

## Research & Background
I used the website called [Wix](https://www.wix.com/) where it offers free web hosting and a built-in open development platform called Velo. I watched videos and studied how to use the platform and applied what I learned into my website. I did research on e-commerce websites and read about what made them successful, how to make it look appealing, and what the basic needs are for the website to be easy to use. 

I had some previous background with working with websites for Systems Analysis & Software Design class but had used the site infinityfree.com.

## Test Results
When the user first goes to the website, they are directed to the Shop page which also acts as the home page. Here the user can view the products that are for sale and able to see if the product is a new arrival, on sale, or sold out.

The user then can click on a product and the site will direct the user to the product page which displays more detail about the product and the price.
![Test Case 1.2](/media/testPlanMedia/TestCase1.2.png)

The user can add to cart where a sidemenu will pop up with a display of the users cart along with the subtotal. From this page, the user can naviagte to the cart page by clicking the view cart button.
![Test Case 1.1](/media/testPlanMedia/TestCase1.1.png)

From the cart page, the products that are in cart, order summary and total are displayed. The user have the options to checkout, paypal or pay later.

## Challenges Overcome
The challenges that I had to overcome is building a website in general and making it work the way you want to. I also had to learn how to use the platform Velo which works similary to the development platform Apache Netbeans. I was able to overcome the challenge of hosting my website by using Wix which hosted the site for free and even has integrated code snippets and APIs for you to use.

## Future Enhancements
A future enhancement that I would like to do is to flesh out an admin page so the admin doesn't have to go to the dashboard of Wix and can just do things on the admin side from the website itself.
