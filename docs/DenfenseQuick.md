## Statement of Purpose (with Problem Statement)
The purpose for this project is to have a working e-commerce (online shopping) website that can handle sales transactions, inventory tracking, and saves information/receipts in a database for a certain amount of time before it deletes it. The customer should be able to view products and make a purchase and with the purchase, see that the transaction is a success and money is taken from the source of pay provided. Along with a purchase, the admin of the website should see that a transaction was made and see the purchases.

The problem is that the client only has Facebook as a way of communication and prompting through Facebook and word-by-mouth. In order for the client to expand their business, they need a website to read a bigger audience. The reason for a bigger audience is so that they can sell premade clothes, display the products, and another way for the clients’ customers to get in contact with them to ask questions or for alterations.
  
The solution to the problem is to make an e-commerce website for the client’s business for the customers to browse through the premade products in stock and see past products that were made. This also facilitates transactions between the client and their customers since multiple transactions from different customers can happen at the same time compared to only making one transaction at a time when meeting face-to-face. The website provides a faster way of shopping for the customers since everything will be a click away wherever they are located and gives more time to the client in order to focus on making the products.

## Research & Background
I used the websiite called [Wix](https://www.wix.com/) where it offers free web hosting and a built in open development platform called Velo. I watched videos and studied how to use the platform and applied what I learned into my website. I did research on e-commerce websites and read about what made them successful, how to make it look appealing, and what the basic needs are for the website to be easy to use.
