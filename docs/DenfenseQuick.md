## Statement of Purpose (with Problem Statement)
The purpose for this project is to have a working e-commerce (online shopping) website that can handle sales transactions, inventory tracking, and saves information/receipts in a database for a certain amount of time before it deletes it. The customer should be able to view products and make a purchase and with the purchase, see that the transaction is a success and money is taken from the source of pay provided. Along with a purchase, the admin of the website should see that a transaction was made and see the purchases.

The problem is that the client only has Facebook as a way of communication and prompting through Facebook and word-by-mouth. In order for the client to expand their business, they need a website to read a bigger audience. The reason for a bigger audience is so that they can sell premade clothes, display the products, and another way for the clients’ customers to get in contact with them to ask questions or for alterations.
  
The solution to the problem is to make an e-commerce website for the client’s business for the customers to browse through the premade products in stock and see past products that were made. This also facilitates transactions between the client and their customers since multiple transactions from different customers can happen at the same time compared to only making one transaction at a time when meeting face-to-face. The website provides a faster way of shopping for the customers since everything will be a click away wherever they are located and gives more time to the client in order to focus on making the products.

## Research & Background
I used the website called [Wix](https://www.wix.com/) where it offers free web hosting and a built-in open development platform called Velo. I watched videos and studied how to use the platform and applied what I learned into my website. I did research on e-commerce websites and read about what made them successful, how to make it look appealing, and what the basic needs are for the website to be easy to use. 

I had some previous background with working with websites for Systems Analysis & Software Design class but had used the site infinityfree.com.

## Test Results
When the user first goes to the website, they are directed to the Shop page which also acts as the home page. Here the user can view the products that are for sale and able to see if the product is a new arrival, on sale, or sold out.

The Portfolio page is accessed by the navigation bar. Here, the projects are on displayed and a timed slideshow.

![Test Case 3](/media/testPlanMedia/TestCase3.png)


Once the user clicks on a project, they are directed to a more detailed page of the project. It displays the title, description, and project type or medium along with the picture of the project on a bigger scale.

![Test Case 3.2](/media/testPlanMedia/TestCase3.2.png)


The Log In page can be naviagted to by clicking on the login button on any page which is diplayed in the top left corner above the navigation bar. Once clicked on, the user is directed to the Log In page where they are asked to log in with Google, Facebook or email. If the user does not have an account, they will click the Sign Up button which is located beneath the Log In header.

Upon clicking the Sign Up button, the user is able to go back to Log In page, sign up with Google, Facebook, or email.

In this case, the user clicked sign up with email and is prompted to enter an email and password.

When an account has already been made, the user cannot sign up again if the email still exists in the database. An error message will be displayed.

## Challenges Overcome
The challenges that I had to overcome is building a website in general and making it work the way you want to. I also had to learn how to use the platform Velo which works similary to the development platform Apache Netbeans. I was able to overcome the challenge of hosting my website by using Wix which hosted the site for free and even has integrated code snippets and APIs for you to use.

## Future Enhancements
A future enhancement that I would like to do is to flesh out an admin page so the admin doesn't have to go to the dashboard of Wix and can just do things on the admin side from the website itself.
